Project: Data Cleaning with SQL on a Tech Layoffs Dataset by Dumisani Mukuchura
By: Dumisani Maxwell Mukuchura
Email: dumisanimukuchura@gmail.com
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022

Description:
Building on the cleaned dataset from Part 1, this project performs comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on tech industry layoffs using SQL. The analysis progresses from basic aggregations to advanced window functions, uncovering trends in layoffs by time, geography, industry, and company stage.

Key Sections:
ðŸ”¹ Basic Analysis: Aggregations, time trends, and geographical distributions.
ðŸ”¹ Intermediate Analysis: Company rankings, financial correlations, and temporal patterns.
ðŸ”¹ Advanced Analysis: Cumulative metrics, anomaly detection, and industry-country insights.

/* Answer:
Understanding the t-value (-0.497)
The t-value measures how different the two group means (U.S. vs. Non-U.S.) are relative to their natural variability.

-Key Interpretation:
- Magnitude (0.497):
- The difference between groups is about 0.5 standard errors.
- This is a small-to-moderate effect size.

-Negative Sign:
- Indicates the first group (U.S. with 0.191) has a lower average than the second group (Non-U.S. with 0.242).

-Statistical Significance:
For a threshold of |t| > 2 (p < 0.05), your result (-0.497) suggests:
- No statistically significant difference between U.S. and Non-U.S. layoff percentages.

-What The Results Show:
Group	   Avg % Laid Off	t-value	Interpretation
U.S.	   19.1%	        -0.497	Lower than Non-U.S., but not significantly so
Non-U.S.   24.2%	        (same t-value)	Higher than U.S., but difference could be random

-Practical Meaning:
Observed Difference:
Non-U.S. companies average 5.1 percentage points higher layoffs (24.2% vs 19.1%).
-Statistical Confidence:
This difference isn't large enough to rule out random chance (p > 0.05).
Need more data or tighter variance to confirm if real.

- Effect Size Context:
- A 5.1% difference may still be practically important for business decisions, even if not statistically significant.
