Project: Data Cleaning with SQL on a Tech Layoffs Dataset by Dumisani Mukuchura
By: Dumisani Maxwell Mukuchura
Email: dumisanimukuchura@gmail.com
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022

Description:
Building on the cleaned dataset from Part 1, this project performs comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on tech industry layoffs using SQL. The analysis progresses from basic aggregations to advanced window functions, uncovering trends in layoffs by time, geography, industry, and company stage.

Key Sections:
ðŸ”¹ Basic Analysis: Aggregations, time trends, and geographical distributions.
ðŸ”¹ Intermediate Analysis: Company rankings, financial correlations, and temporal patterns.
ðŸ”¹ Advanced Analysis: Cumulative metrics, anomaly detection, and industry-country insights.

Low Layoff Cluster: Unknown, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series A, Series F, Seed, Series H, Series G
Medium Layoff Cluster: Acquired, Series E, Private Equity, Subsidiary, Series I, Series J
High Layoff Cluster: PostIPO

-- 3.4.2. How long after funding do layoffs typically occur?

-- Response: This question is not Answerable with the current information we do not have dates where rounds of funding happened we just have a mention of date of layoff and the stage when that happened.
