Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022

Description:
Building on the cleaned dataset from Part 1, this project performs comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on tech industry layoffs using SQL. The analysis progresses from basic aggregations to advanced window functions, uncovering trends in layoffs by time, geography, industry, and company stage.

Key Sections:
ðŸ”¹ Basic Analysis: Aggregations, time trends, and geographical distributions.
ðŸ”¹ Intermediate Analysis: Company rankings, financial correlations, and temporal patterns.
ðŸ”¹ Advanced Analysis: Cumulative metrics, anomaly detection, and industry-country insights.

/*Thoughts on the 2 above Implementations:

Limitations:
1. Using two separate queries requires manual calculation
2. The average might be skewed by extreme outliers (max 27,200 vs avg ~870)
3. Equal values (= 870.37) are excluded (though rare)
